## Importing the Project
1. Download the [emily-cli repository files](https://github.com/amboltio/emily-cli).
	* You can either clone or download as a ZIP (remember to unzip)
2. Open a terminal and locate the `tutorials` folder
3. Run ```$ emily open ./house-price-prediction/house-price-prediction-api``` to import the Emily project
4. Choose the `Slim` Emily image with no deep learning platform
5. Select Visual Studio Code as the editor to use


## Running the API
1. Open api.py and press `F5` or press the green _play_ icon in the top right 
	* This will host the API on port _4242_
	* (Alternatively run ```$ python api.py``` in the Visual Studio Code terminal)
2. You can check it on [http://localhost:4242/api/health](http://localhost:4242/api/health)
* You can also check the available API endpoints at [http://localhost:4242/docs](http://localhost:4242/docs)

## Interacting with the API
### Launch the client
1. Go to `tutorials/house-price-prediction/house-price-prediction-client/`
2. Launch the `index.html` file
      * Your project is now running in your browser!
3. Play around with `square feet`, `condition`, and `year build` to get predictions.
